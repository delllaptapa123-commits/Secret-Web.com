<h3><a>Timmy Rain is an urban legend that this time comes from a country. Yes, what other country if not Norway! So Timmy Rain is the guardian of an old village that has been dead since 1987-1990. So the story is said that Timmy Rain was originally a cheerful boy born in 1982 who loved playing in the snow. Until one day this boy received a curse from a much older entity there. The villagers had no other choice but to sacrifice the boy. Until one day the boy was torn apart and burned alive to be used as an offering to the old entity. Until 1990, all the residents decided to leave the </a><a href="https://lomando.com/main.html">curse </a><a>village.</a></h3>
<h3><a>It's believed Timmy Rain is now conspiring with the old entity to avenge the two of them, who suffered the same tragic fate: being burned and torn apart alive. It's unclear who the old entity is, but it's thought to have inhabited the area since 1105, during the Middle Ages.</a></h3>
